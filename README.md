# Comprescore
COMPRESCORE - COMPRESSION EFFICENCY TESTING TOOL
Comprescore is compression algorithm's efficency checking tool, currently comes for only Linux enviroment checks whether the compression algorithm stands in its terms and perform compression (Lossy/Lossles).
This tool gives a score value which is computed by inbuilt [weissman score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weissman_score#:~:text=The%20Weissman%20score%20is%20a%20fictional%20efficiency%20metric%20for%20lossless%20compression%20applications.) algorithm.
Note: Higher the Score better the Compression Algorithm.

## SUPPORTED COMPRESSION ALGORITHMS
```bash
bzip2 (ext/.bzip2)
```
```bash
gzip (ext/.gz)
```
